## 1.1

- Specific responses for the following APIs have been added: Topics Extraction, Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification. These responses provide auxiliary functions to work with the results returned by each one of those APIs.
- MCRequest has changed: now a generic request does not return an MCResponse object, but a string that needs to be parsed. Additional functions have been added to use the new response classes added.
- Metadata in composer has been updated.
