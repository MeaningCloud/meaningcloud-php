# MeaningCloud for PHP

This is MeaningCloud's official PHP client, designed to enable you to use MeaningCloud's services easily from your own applications.


## Getting started

### Installation

You can load meaningcloud-php into your project by using Composer (https://getcomposer.org/).

If you already have composer installed, you just need to run the following:

``` 
composer require meaningcloud/public/meaningcloud-php
```

### Configuration

The only thing you need to start using MeaningCloud's APIs is to log into MeaningCloud (by registering or using other services to log in). Once you've done that, you will be given a license key (https://www.meaningcloud.com/developer/account/subscription). Copy it and paste it in the corresponding place in the code, select the API you want to use and the parameters you want to use, and that's it.
